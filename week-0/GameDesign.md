- Project file
  [Die Hard with a Scratch.sb3](./sb3/Die%20Hard%20with%20a%20Scratch.sb3) is

The below specifies a design for a quick game implemented in Scratch.

The game is inspired by the Die Hard film series and based on the ubiquitous
character of Hans Gruber. It is a single player game where the player controls
the character of Hans Gruber and must avoid projectiles thrown by the character
of Mrs. McClane.

The game is a remembrance of the classic game of "[Super Dodge Ball][2]". An
action game that was released by Technos Japan in 1987.

#### Concept

A single player game where you play as a Hans Gruber character, trying to dodge
various objects thrown at you by a pretty upset Mrs. McClane.

The game is a parody of the Die Hard film series and arrives at a perfect time
for a Die Hard Christmas binge!

**Merry Christmas Everyone!**

#### Demographic

- Target Audience: Classic game fans and Die Hard film fans, any age
- Game Style: Jump and Move
- Platform: Scratch [(https://scratch.mit.edu/)][1]
- Players: 1 (Single Player mode)
- Controls: Keyboard (Space bar, left and right arrow keys)

#### Description

Die Hard's Hans Gruber is considered one of the greatest movie villains of all
time. Hans Gruber used a lot of theatrics during his takeover of Nakatomi Plaza
in Die Hard, initially leaving everyone at the Christmas party to assume he and
his men were terrorists. It was a ruse they continued to use during their
interactions with the police and the FBI to further their goals.

However, Gruber wasn't above showcasing his intelligence by teasing his hostages
with the revelation that he and his teams were simply high-stakes robbers
looking for a big store. The game highlights Gruber's manipulations and the joy
he took from playing with others' perceptions of his crimes.

This adrenaline-fuelled, arcade style game is predominately based on Holly
Gennero, formerly Holly McClane, the ex-wife of John McClane. She has made her
mission to throw at Gruber any kind of object that she can find to stop him from
his machiavellian plans.

A fictional Los Angeles environment is also presented in the game with the
famous Nakatomi Plaza tower in distress.

Sounds and special effects are provided by the game to combine usability with
presence and immersion in the fictional game world of Die Hard and hopefully
enhance playability of the game.
