## Specification

### Brief

#### Scratch

It’s time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply, is to
implement in Scratch, at [scratch.mit.edu][1], any project of your choice, be it
an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the
following requirements:

- Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not
  be a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily
  three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at
  least one variable.
- Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself
  (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in
  lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be
  less complex than [Oscartime][2] and [Ivy’s Hardest Game][3].
- To meet these requirements, your project should probably use a few dozen
  puzzle pieces overall. And your code should ideally be not only correct but
  also well-designed. If one of your scripts is getting a bit long, try to break
  it up into multiple scripts (each of which does something specific). And try
  to leverage “abstraction” where possible: if you can imagine giving a
  descriptive name to a sequence of blocks (e.g., meow), those could probably
  be moved to a custom block!

If you’d like some inspiration from past students, here are just a few:

- [It’s Raining Men][4], from lecture
- [Soccer][5], a game
- [Cookie Love Story][6], an animation
- [Gingerbread tales][7], an interactive story
- [Intersection][8], a game
- [Hogwarts][9], a game

You might find these [tutorials][10] or [starter projects][11] helpful. And
you’re welcome to explore [scratch.mit.edu][1] for inspiration. But try to
think of an idea on your own, and then set out to implement it. However, don’t
try to implement the entirety of your project all at once: tackle one piece at
a time, just as we did in lecture. In other words, take baby steps: write a
bit of code (i.e., drag and drop a few puzzle pieces), test, write a bit more,
test, and so forth. And select File > Save now every few minutes so that you
don’t lose any work!

If, along the way, you find it too difficult to implement some feature, try not
to fret; alter your design or work around the problem. If you set out to
implement an idea that you find fun, odds are you won’t find it too hard to
satisfy the above requirements.

Alright, off you go. Make us proud!

Once finished with your project, select File > Save now one last time. Then
select File > Save to your computer and keep that file so that you can submit
it. If prompted by your computer to Open or Save the file, be sure to Save it.

### Actions taken

#### Step 1 of 2
