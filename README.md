## Course Syllabus

### Week 0 Scratch

Scratch is a free programming language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations.

For Week 0, I have created a game called "Die Hard with a Scratch" which is based on the Die Hard film series and based on the ubiquitous character of Hans Gruber. It is a single player game where the player controls the character of Hans Gruber and must avoid baseballs thrown by the character of Mrs. McClane. For more information, please see the [Game Design Document](Week%200/GameDesign.md).
