## CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science

This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems
efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures,
encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web
programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and
sciences.

## Course Syllabus

### Week 0 Scratch

Scratch is a free programming language and online community where you can create
your own interactive stories, games, and animations.

For Week 0, I have created a game called "Die Hard with a Scratch" which is
based on the Die Hard film series and based on the ubiquitous character of Hans
Gruber. It is a single player game where the player controls the character of
Hans Gruber and must avoid projectiles thrown by the character of Mrs. McClane.
